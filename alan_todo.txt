ToDo
NTP DST implementation

Thermostat timeout for all sources


Done
Avoid thermostat cycling - timestamp relay activations and set limit 
	(possibly make dedicated function for relay on/off with TS and check on the ON.. should always be able to turn it off)

Config items for MQTT timeout & thermostat cycling

Display of a bad or stale temperature should update on thermostat.html page  and not keep last reading

Fix bug where thermostat off time is update is it is already off

Change thermostat to work in tenths of a degree, not hundredths

Remove used references to thermostat2 & thermostat3 (commented as may use in future version)

Publish state to MQTT - thermostat (on/off, mode)+ relays 

Publish all ds18b20 sensors to MQTT by device-id

Choose which relays associate to each thermostat
	Disable thermostat and turn relays off
	when they relay state is change via webpage

FOTA upgrade now down via webpage push (about.tpl) - thank you #esp-link project
