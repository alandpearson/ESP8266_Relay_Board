ToDo

Add timeout for userJSON publication (timestamp the serial input)
Add thermostat manual/auto mode to ui.tpl


Configurable GPIO for relays (via webpage?)


Done
Avoid thermostat cycling - timestamp relay activations and set limit 
	(possibly make dedicated function for relay on/off with TS and check on the ON.. should always be able to turn it off)

Config items for MQTT timeout & thermostat cycling

Display of a bad or stale temperature should update on thermostat.html page  and not keep last reading

Fix bug where thermostat off time is update is it is already off

Change thermostat to work in tenths of a degree, not hundredths

Remove used references to thermostat2 & thermostat3 (commented as may use in future version)

Publish state to MQTT - thermostat (on/off, mode)+ relays 

Publish all ds18b20 sensors to MQTT by device-id

Choose which relays associate to each thermostat

FOTA upgrade now down via webpage push (about.tpl) - thank you #esp-link project

Thermostat timeout for all sources implemented

Move all thermostat config to its own page in the Web GUI

ESPFS webpage upload now available through the Web GUI

Tidy up about.tpl page and only show firmware upgrade options when flash_map > 2 (over 512Kb)
Disable URLs for flashing firmware if flash_map < 2

Supports DST for Europe and North America (thanks Martin Harizanov for the code template)

Correct relay active for thermostat indicated in MQTT and JSON feeds (instead of relay1 default).

CurrentSetPoint published in state JSONs

Number of relays is now configurable via UI - if relay is not configured, it cannot be actuated via any means.
	Means code should work on 1-Relay boards and have correct UI and logic

Relays configured as thermostat controlled cannot be actuated via any other means (webpages, IO calls, MQTT)

Main menu updated

UI overview page completed  to show most things and available on main menu (need to do ds18B20 sensors)

Thermostat colour map gradients configurable from web UI

Display all DS18B20 & DHT22 sensor values on new UI overview page

Tidy up serial interface - add help and validation of inputs

Add serial userjson input - JSON can be submitted via serial and is published to MQTT and thermostat.cgi?state to allow easy customisation of webpages to support random serial devices

Added schedule override mode

	user_params parameter added to main CGI to return them as JSON
	publish them to MQTT ?


Added syslog server

Made thermostat name configurable and page title to be thermostat name

Made thermostat schedule downloadable
